# Abstract

This directory contains a few bash scripts for tmux, that aims to provide a better developer experience for browsing tmux sessions.
You can think of it as an alternative to tmux (tree mode)[https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started#choosing-sessions-windows-and-panes], but with fuzzy search.

The initial implementation is created from ThePrimeagen, this project is just an addon of his bash script.

## Features

- tmux-sessionizer: quick jump to existing sessions by different categorries (personal,work,uni). Please change it according to your dir structure
- tmux-ls-sessionizer: fuzzy find existing tmux sessions and jump to it
- tmux-del-sessionizer: fuzzy find existing tmux sessions and delete it

## Instructions

Just copy-paste the bash files in your local directory at: `.local/bin/`, and make sure you can execute them: `chmod u+x tmux-*`.
